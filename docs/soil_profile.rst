Soil Profile
############


Most of the design problems encountered in Soil Mechanics involve calculations
with geotechnical properties of soil profiles that have been deduced from raw
geotechnical data. Case in point, recomendended step-by-step design procedures
within `FHWA GEC 012`_ start by delineating the soil profile into layers using
soil test data.

The process of delineating the soil profile into layers is easier said than
done and is based on engineering judgement and experience. For example, the
figure below shows the SPT N values collected during field tests for "North
Abutment S-1" (after `FHWA GEC 012`_).
